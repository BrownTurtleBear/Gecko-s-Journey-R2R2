# Gecko-s-Journey-R2R2
A complete data set of every race Gecko has raced.

## Why?
Data is great. It is fun to analyse and very helpfull for every competetive scene. I enjoy collecting data and watching Gecko's videos. I think it would be fun to analyse all of his R2R2 races to see how he can get to ruby 2 quicker.
